# UncertaintyEnsembleForecastMaps
Data and R code for performing HSIC-based GSA for coastal flood maps using an example of Rohmer et al. (2026, submitted).

[1] Unzip all files
[2] Run the R script which takes as inputs:
  - the 1050 configurations of the 6-dimensional inputs
  - the 1050 flood maps (in 4 different files to save space) 
[3] Analyse the HSIC first-order sensitivity measures

**Necessary R package: [sensitivity](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sensitivity/index.html).
